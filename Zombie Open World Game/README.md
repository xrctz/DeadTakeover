# DeadTakeover

DeadTakeover is a browser-based open-world zombie survival FPS built with **Three.js** and **Vite**.  
Fight through escalating hordes, build barricades, scavenge resources, and survive across multiple hostile maps with AI teammates.

## Why This Project

This game is focused on high-intensity survival loops inside the browser:

- Progression systems (materials, perks, and defensive building) that reward long runs

## Gameplay Highlights

- **AI teammates** that assist in combat and survival
- **Special infected roster** including Spitter, Hunter, Charger, Crawler, Juggernaut, Boomer, and Screamer
- **Barricade system** with wood and metal variants
- **Material scavenging** from combat encounters
- **Skill/perk upgrades** for damage, health, speed, reload, and headshot bonuses
- **Dynamic world pressure** via weather systems, day/night cycle, and horde spikes
- **Combat feedback systems** like kill feed, floating damage numbers, and enemy HP bars
